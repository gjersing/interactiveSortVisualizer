# interactiveSortVisualizer
An interactive sorting visualizer utilizing Tkinter.

Run by executing main.py.\
Opens a Tkinter interactive executable with sliders for the # of items to sort, the max and min values, as well as the speed of sorting.\
*Note that speed means it will sleep for the time set after every compare/swap. \

I practiced a lot of Tkinter with this project, as well as implementing sorting algorithms with functionality past just swapping.\
A main focus of the project was to make it very usable and difficult to break so try your best to beat the system and let me know if you do!\
Currently there is a crash that occurs when trying to click outside of the window while sorting but I believe that is related to Tkinter itself.\
